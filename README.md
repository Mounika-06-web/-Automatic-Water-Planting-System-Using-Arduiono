# -Automatic-Water-Planting-System-Using-Arduiono
An Automatic Watering System using Arduino is a project designed to water plants automatically based on soil moisture levels. It uses an Arduino board, soil moisture sensor, and a water pump to monitor and control the watering process.
In daily operations related to farming or gardening watering is the most important practice 
and the most laborintensive task. No matter whichever weather it is, either too hot and dry or 
too cloudy and wet, you want to be able to control the amount of water that reaches your 
plants. Modern watering systems could be effectively used to water plants when they need it. 
But this manual process of watering requires two important aspects to be considered: when 
and how much to water. In order to replace manual activities and making gardener's work 
easier, we have create automatic plant watering system. By adding automated plant watering 
system to the garden or agricultural field, you will help all of the plants reach their fullest 
potential as well as conserving water. Using sprinklers drip emitters, or a combination of 
both, we have design a system that is ideal for every plant in the yard. For implementation of 
automatic plant watering system, we have used combination of sprinkler systems, pipes, and 
nozzles. In this paper we have used ATmega328 microcontroller. It is programmed to sense 
moisture level of plants at particular instance of time, if the moisture content is less than 
specified threshold which is predefined according to particular plant's water need then 
desired amount of water is supplied till it reaches threshold. Generally, plants need to be 
watered twice a day, morning and evening. Thus, the microcontroller is programmed to water 
plants two times per day. System is designed in such a way that it reports its current state as 
well as remind the user to add water to the tank. All this notifications are made through 
mobile application. We hope that through this prototype we all can enjoy having plants, 
without being worried about absent or forgetfulness.
